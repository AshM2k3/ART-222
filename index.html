<p> Reflection on this design:  <br>
<br>
My process consisted of a lot of inspiration collecting on the internet. A lot of this happened on Pinterest, but also on Google looking at images of the Southworth Planetarium itself. For this specific project, it was also on a very nostalgic location to me, so I used personal memories to fuel a lot of my design decisions as well. I decided on a couple key components I knew I wanted to incorporate, which ended up being space, specifically saturn's rings, the community aspect that the planetarium engages in (especially bringing in families and kids), and the nostalgic, retro theming. From there I went to sketching, saturn’s rings played theme in a lot of my designs… which got me to my final sketch of my design. The nostalgia and retro theme mostly informed color choices. <br>
I got a lot of great feedback during the critique periods. Including trying a full sized image, which I then went back to AI and created a second design, making a full image, not just a cropped corner one like my original design had. I agreed that not having a full design may be difficult for some logo placement, so I wanted to make an alternative version. I also got critiques regarding color on dark backgrounds, which I agree, would need to be edited, and also got feedback to add shadows. <br>
Especially looking at this from an outside perspective, I agree with needing an alternative for dark backgrounds and the full image. I did specifically leave it without shadows to lend to the 2d element and wanting it to feel really retro and sticker like. Looking further at the design, I think the rings and planet could be more smooth, though the crookedness does feel retro, I think to read properly it needs to be more exaggerated.

<p> Reflection on this design:  <br>
<br>

These pieces juxtaposed with each other turned out in a way I am incredibly happy with. I set out with an explicit story to tell, and I feel like I accomplished that. I wanted to find a reawakening of the Y2k scare meeting our current AI scares of today, which was my biggest inspiration when creating these images.I worked a lot with color pallets, positioning of each image, and ensuring that it felt like the same place with jarring differences. <br>



Stepping back from my art I think I could do a bit better with lighting, and meshing the images on top of each other to look like they really belong in the environment, and are not just photoshopped in (like they literally were). However, considering how long I spent tweaking light levels, I don’t hate it. I also wish I could find a way to hint more into that they are tied together, and find more details to add to hint at the simulation overlaying the real world. I wanted to have incorporated a few more elements, and allowed for even more to be going on in the images, but I did not want to overly crowd them, and take away from the focal points. <br>
 

I got good feedback that my main figures in Glasses On looked a little flat, which depending on the design choice, could actually work in my favor. I did appreciate that feedback, but I was actually happy it read that way, as I was hoping to make them seem a little out of place, due to the fact that it was supposed to be a simulation. <br>


Regardless, I think it reads well as a think piece, that is definitely pretty jarring comparing the two. I think it offers a pretty horror centered take on a possible reality that prays on current events, which is what I was hoping for. So overall, I am pretty proud of these works. <p>

<p> Reflection on this design:  <br>

<br>

In the beginning of this project, when I was imagining what it could be prior to any content restrictions, my vision was very different. However, once I launched into this project, saw what conent I was working with, and starting creating, its form really shifted, and molded into what it is now. I could not be happier about this. This project was very important to me and as I worked on it it became something I was incredibly proud to put out into the world. This video represents the conditioning and grooming that we push onto girls from even before they can make their own choices. Onsies and toys gender and push them in a direction of sexualizaiton and the expectation of objectification by men before they even know what sex is. This has always disgusted me and I find it is not something that gets discussed enough, even with feminism becoming more prevelant and talked about. <br>

This video represents the "shift" from a girl to a woman, yet how blurry those lines really are. I used a lot of clips from menstration education videos, which emphsized the fact that as soon as you get your period, you are a woman. The moment you are a woman, you are ready and willing to be sexualized by men. At least that is what a lot of the videos I watched were hinting to. I purposefully choice to size my video when there were underage girls differently from adult women to represent this very fine yet crucial line. I also chose audio clips to tie in seemingly unrelated content, connecting it back into the bigger picture and its importance. Flowers blooming and wilting represent the coming of age and how easily it can be destroyed and beaten down. This video aims to inform and critique the conditioning and grooming of young girls, and to encourage breaking away from this mold by empowering women. <br>

<br>

Stepping back from my art, I think that this is a pretty solid piece of work. The video clips, audio, and editing styles are consistent and used fluidly throughout. It is jerky and random, but eludes to the nature of the content. The audio choices make it abraidsive and uncomfortable paired with the video, but it feels like it should. It shouldn't be comfortable. Choices feel purposeful and explicit. If I had more time with it, it would have been nice to see more clips from different videos and more content or audio clips that tie things togetether. I spent a lot of time weeding through seemingly unrelated videos finding absolute gems of content, and with more time on the project, I may have been able to find more. However, overall I am conent with how this video turned out and especially proud of the message it conveys.
