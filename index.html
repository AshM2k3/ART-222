<p> Reflection on this design:  <br>
<br>
My process consisted of a lot of inspiration collecting on the internet. A lot of this happened on Pinterest, but also on Google looking at images of the Southworth Planetarium itself. For this specific project, it was also on a very nostalgic location to me, so I used personal memories to fuel a lot of my design decisions as well. I decided on a couple key components I knew I wanted to incorporate, which ended up being space, specifically saturn's rings, the community aspect that the planetarium engages in (especially bringing in families and kids), and the nostalgic, retro theming. From there I went to sketching, saturn’s rings played theme in a lot of my designs… which got me to my final sketch of my design. The nostalgia and retro theme mostly informed color choices. <br>
I got a lot of great feedback during the critique periods. Including trying a full sized image, which I then went back to AI and created a second design, making a full image, not just a cropped corner one like my original design had. I agreed that not having a full design may be difficult for some logo placement, so I wanted to make an alternative version. I also got critiques regarding color on dark backgrounds, which I agree, would need to be edited, and also got feedback to add shadows. <br>
Especially looking at this from an outside perspective, I agree with needing an alternative for dark backgrounds and the full image. I did specifically leave it without shadows to lend to the 2d element and wanting it to feel really retro and sticker like. Looking further at the design, I think the rings and planet could be more smooth, though the crookedness does feel retro, I think to read properly it needs to be more exaggerated.
